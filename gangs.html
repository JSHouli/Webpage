<h1>Gangs of Night City</h1>
<br>
<p>The streets of Night City are infested with gangs but there are a few groups of violent individuals who stand out from the rest.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Maelstrom Gang</h2>
<img src="images/maelstrom.jpg">
<br>
<p>One of the most infamous gangs of Night City, the Maelstroms are a combat-heavy gang that is obsessed with cybertechnology and body modification. This makes most of them look fully cyborg in appearance but leads to cyberpsychosis, a mental illness leading to a general loss of humanity that can be brought upon by installing too much cyberware into your body. As a result, Maelstrom members will attack nearly anyone outside their crews.
Given their extreme body modification, Maelstrom is one of the smaller gangs in the city, numbering at 1,300. But their combat mods more than make up for lack of numbers, as they can be quite challenging to face and can sustain otherwise fatal injuries. Their primary turf is the industrial area of the Watson District, where they are in conflict with the Tyger Claws gang.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Tyger Claws</h2>
<img src="images/tyger.jpg">
<br>
<p>A primarily Asian gang, the Tyger Claws are among the largest and most powerful gangs in the city. They employ methods inspired by both Japan's Yakuza and China's Triads. Their primary source of income involves trafficking and prostitution, but they use more legit businesses as fronts and money laundering than any other gang.
The organization is highly rumored to be backed by the Japanese Corporation Arasaka, who supply them with top of the line weapons and cybernetic augmentations. In return, the Tyger Claws will occasionally receive jobs that the above-board company can't afford to be involved in. One of their leaders is Wakako Okada, a fixer who hires mercenaries for jobs that the other gang members can't handle. The gang's leadership prefers to handle matters through business if it can be helped, but they aren't afraid of getting their hands dirty if push comes to shove.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Valentinos</h2>
<img src="images/valentinos.jpg">
<br>
<p>An old gang with a history that goes back to when Night City was first founded, the Valentinos are one of the more traditional crime syndicates, following orthodox Christianity. While primarily a Latino gang, they are not above accepting new members from other ethnic groups. They value honor and loyalty so much that those who betray the gang are made an example, while those who sacrifice their lives become martyrs.
From their Turf within the Heywood District, they are one of the largest gangs in the city, numbering more than 6,000 strong. Using the loyalty they cultivated from the local communities, the Valentinos own many legitimate businesses they use for laundering or as a cover for illegal activity such as car theft, gun smuggling and robbery.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Voodoo Boys</h2>
<img src="images/voodoo.jpg">
<br>
<p>One of the more mysterious gangs of the city, the Voodoo Boys are a Haitian gang based in what remains of the Pacifica District, just south of the rest of the city. In 2062, global warming lead to the entirety of Haiti being swallowed by the ocean, with refugees making their way to the West Coast. Originally built as a luxury resort town, Pacifica was abandoned and turned into nothing short of an active war zone, where even the police avoid patrolling there. This has led to the Voodoo Boys becoming the de facto leaders and guardians of Haitian refugees' safety and interests.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Mox</h2>
<img src="images/moxx.jpg">
<br>
<p>The newest gang to join the struggle for Night City's streets, The Mox is mostly made up of sex workers, anarchists, punks and sexual minorities. The gang was formed shortly after the murder of Lizzie Borden, a strip club owner who treated her employees fairly and protected them, often defying gang members in the process. She was killed when the Tyger Claws raided her bar in 2076. This caused outrage, leading to riots throughout the city that targeted the Claws and many other gangs, with the Moxe's forming shortly afterward.</p>
<p>The Mox was formed primarily for mutual self-defense; thus, the gang is not as territorial or ambitious as other organizations. Besides Lizzie's Bar, they own only a few other establishments in the Watson District and rarely venture beyond what little turf they control. Although a very small gang of just a few hundred members, they're not afraid to fight for what little they have.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Animals</h2>
<img src="images/animals.jpg">
<br>
<p>Animals focus on body enhancements and training that increase their martial ability. Recently present in Pacifica in pursuit of a mysterious goal. Pacifica’s situation with the Animals is a bit mysterious. The Grand Imperial Mall was one of the last developments in Pacifica to lose its funding. Until recently it stood vacant, but recently the Animals began to occupy the building.The Animals are not your normal gang. They value might above all else and wear melee combat implants to raise their prowess in combat. A street term to describe this obsession is “bone-brain buffaloes on steroids.”As sought-after bouncers they are usually dispersed around town, cornering the market in illegal substances, so their recent presence in Pacifica is suspicious. When they converge in one spot it’s for something big, perhaps to appoint the fastest and strongest among them as their ad hoc leader. As V will learn upon exploring the area, the woman named Sasquatch is the one who was chosen to overlook this secret operation.</p>
<br>
<h2>6th Street</h2>
<img src="images/sixthstreet.jpg">
<br>
<p>Found as old-fashioned American patriots, the 6th Street Gang have forgotten their goal of serving those in need and now selfishly abuse their power.Even amidst the iron grip of corporations, the 6th Street Gang found its home in Santo Domingo. Born out of desperate living conditions of its residents and a deep desire for safety, a group of 4th Corporate War veterans formed to protect and serve the community of Vista del Rey.Unfortunately, the initial goal of filling in the role of dysfunctional Night City Police Department for the local citizens didn’t last long. Today the 6th Street Gang’s interpretation of the law and the concept of “bringing justice to the city” became questionable and self-serving.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Wraiths</h2>
<img src="images/wraiths.jpg">
<br>
<p>Breaking all custom and law of the Badlands, Wraiths prey on all small groups of Nomads and corporate transport alike and make for a highly aggressive opponent. Wraiths break with the more accepted behavior of the Nomads, ignoring the law and operating in an aggressive manner. Settled in the outskirts of Night City, they raid small villages and go after smaller groups of Nomads and corporate transports. Nobody is sure where Wraiths have originated, although they most likely share the same exiled history as many other Nomad groups, like Aldecados, who are currently in hot conflict with Wraiths. It’s quite possible that they are a subset of Raffen Shiv, a faction of criminals and outcasts scattered across the Badlands.</p>
<br>
<p>There you have it. A list of all the people you don't want to meet down a dark alleyway unless you're looking for a fight</p>
