<H1>Overlords of the Dark Future</H1>
<br>
<p>The gangs of Night City may rule the streets but the Corporations hold the true power. When it comes to resources, influence and anything else you'd expect from evil corporate overlords, these money driven psychos take the cake</p>
<br>
<h2>Arasaka Corp</h2>

The Arasaka Corporation maintains one of the largest and most powerful armed forces of any corporation in the world. Arasaka guards or troops are renowned worldwide and feared by many. Most firms will look to licensing from Arasaka corporate security guards, couriers, or mercenaries to protect their assets. However Arasaka assets take priority if they are at risk, the troops are loyal until death to the corporation. Arasaka has made a habit of buying up other corporations worldwide, and bleeding out the competition of other Japanese corporations. They also give a heavy amount of support to Japanese communities all over the globe, despite their businesses practices and overall history being considered unethical.</p>
<br>

They will march straight into hell if it meant saving a clients' life...but only if they keep paying.</p>
<br>
<h2>Kang Tao</h2>

<br>
<h2>Kenshiri-Adachi Armaments</h2>
<p>Kenshiri-Adachi Armaments, more commonly known by its abbreviated name, Kendachi, is a Japanese arms manufacturer specializing in advanced technology. Kenshiri-Adachi Armaments, known by all as Kendachi, is a Japanese corporation that mainly specializes in high-quality melee weapons and purpose-built chipware. Kendachi's advanced tech can be found in nearly every city worldwide, as well as their excellent line-up of melee weapons consisting of various katanas and tantos.</p>
<p>You'll be a lucky man if you never come face to face with the beautiful yet fearsome monoblade and its manufacturer. Kendachi was one of the few companies with factories in orbit. Although they had the world's top tech in the making of orbital crystal and glass-fiber. Originally, however, Kendachi lacked the resources and money to even get such advanced tech.</p>
<img src="images/kendachi.png">
<p>Big corporations in Japan often invest funds in small companies with original tech to place them in the exclusive keiretsu system. This is what allowed Kendachi to become what it is today. The Monoblade series, a synonym for Kendachi in some countries, was developed by Kendachi Tessho to demonstrate the uses for his crystal technology to gain funding for a low-profit company.</p>
<p>As a side-note, monoblades were not sold as weapons in Japan. They were only used in industrial equipment. The president, Kendachi-san himself, was also known for his business acumen, but also for his skill at kendo, and his short temper. He sometimes deals with troublemakers himself, with the aid of a crack solo troop. And yes, they are licensed to carry monokatanas in Japan.</p>
<p>The company can trace its origin to the sixteenth-century Kenshiri family's blacksmith, based in Chuo-ku, the original center of historic Edo (Tokyo). As a corporation, Kendachi became widely known in the first two decades of the twenty-first century after their fusion with the Adachi company, conquering the market with a wide range of high-tech monoweapons and flamethrowers. Chuo-ku is still their main headquarters, but today the corporation also has many regional offices in Osaka, Seattle, London, Night City, New York, and Brasilia.</p>
<p>Those are some of the most notable corporations you'll see around town but Night City is infested with corporations so you're bound to see a few unfamiliar names.</p>
