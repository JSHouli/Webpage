<h1>Weapons of Destruction</h1>
<br>
<p>You could go to the nearest ripper doc, get some new cybernetic arms and walk out the most dangerous person in town. So many people have replaced their limbs with dangerous weapons, you'd think more people would risk a life of crime with that kind of power, but, the reason they don't is because anyone on the street could be equally dangerous.</p>
<br>
<h2>Cyberware</h2>

<p>There are numerous types of cyberware that you can upgrade yourself with i.e. Gorilla Arms that give you super strength, Mantis blades that sprout giant swords out of your fore arms or optical eyes so you can analyze your surroundings.</p>

<img src="images/launchgif.gif">
<p>You can shoot rockets out of your wrists, pull a hacking wire out of your wrist that can also be used as a whip or even hand grips that will give you better weapon handling, you name it and it's yours.</p>

<p>The gif above me shows a netrunner using his cybernetic wrist wire to hack into the cyberware of an enemy. Successful hacks can turn the tide of a battle instantly, whether you're hacking your opponent or the surrounding area.</p>
<br>
<h2>Melee Weapons</h2>

<p>Ever wanted a katana? Yes? Well, have you ever wanted a thermal katana with a nano flament heated blade? Congratulations! your dreams have finally come true. Most people thought melee weapons would become obsolete by now but when people started swinging around super heated swords, they quickly changed their minds.</p>
<br>
<h2>Power Weapons</h2>
<img src="images/powergif.gif">
<p>If the ability to cause damage and pain is all you look for in a weapon then look no further because you'll be right at home with power weapons</p>
<p>These are your classic "little friends" that cause not so little injuries and when they're modded with futuristic tech, those injuries are about to get a lot worse.</p>
<br>
<h2>Smart Weapons</h2>
<p>The best thing about smart weapons is that you don't even have to aim. Just aim in the general direction of whatever you're shooting and pull the triger because the bullets track their target!</p>
<img src="images/smart.jpg">
<p>You wanna know the next best thing? Even if you miss, the bullets have a rickochet effect that allows the bullets to bounce around whilst still tracking the target. If smart weapons are the new smart phones, then an AK-47 is a Nokia Brick.</p>
<br>
<h2>Tech Weapons</h2>
<p>When thinking of Tech weapons, you're thinking low fire rate but extremely hight penetration. Sniper rifles, shotguns, heavy pistols and so forth. Now, they're techy because they can do stuff that other weapons can't, like ripping through an armored vehicle, wall or other obstacles like paper.</p>
