<h1>Tourist Hotspots in a Dystopian Future</h1>
<br>
<p>There's a variety of districs in Night City ranging from the corrupt corporate city center all the way to the desolate badlands but they all share one thing; The possibility of death is always there so if you're interested in sightseeing, I'd suggest taking a weapon</p>
<br>
<h2>City Center</h2>
<p>City Center is the central business district of Night City and the commercial hub of the metropolitan area. Most of the City's corporations operate from the city center.</p>
<img src="images/citycentreone.jpg">
<p>City Center is the real showcase of Night City. The once smoldering battlefield of the 4th Corporate War and nuclear fallout from the Arasaka Tower assault, was now completely restored. Restoration of the district was a lengthy and costly process — it started in the 2030s and ended just recently, when the Arasaka Tower was rebuilt in the 2070s.</p> 
<p>By 2077, it was now the most fortified district in all of Night City. Filled with modern, cutting-edge architecture, City Center is where anyone can witness the unrivaled might of megacorporations. This is where the rich and overworked spend their lives, building up the economic power of Night City. The Corpo Plaza is reaching for the sky with its brutal corporate skyscrapers and blinding floodlights.</p> 
<img src="images/citycentretwo.jpg">
<p>This is the heart of the district and the home to some of the biggest corporations such as Arasaka, Militech, Biotechnica, Petrochem, and Kang Tao. Next to it is Downtown. It's full of narrow alleys, night clubs, celebrities, and corporate stiffs. Here you'll find an abundance of office buildings and eccentrically shaped architecture — as well as exclusive apartments, hotels, and restaurants.</p> 
<img src="images/citycentrethree.jpg">
<p>Its northern waterfront is a mecca for artists and snobs, with galleries, concert halls and ateliers around every corner. Despite the elegance and power of Downtown, it isn't as secure as it would seem: turn down the wrong alley and you'll find yourself en-route to sleazy love hotels, dive bars, and shadowy corners where drug deals — and worse — are a common occurrence.</p>
<br>
<h2>Westbrook</h2>
<img src="images/westbrookthree.jpg">
<br>
<p>The Westbrook District of Night City is home to many wealthy elites, celebrities, and corporates. It is also home to Japantown, an especially important part of Night City for two main reasons. First being, it's the cultural center for the city's sizable Japanese community. The second reason being, Japantown is home base for most of the Yakuza families operating throughout the Free State of North Carolina; it's centrally located, has limited police interference,and outsiders tend to stick out like a sore thumb. The Tyger Claws are the dominant gang in the district and are considered to rule it but only at night in order to avoid the heavy presence of corporate security.</p>
<br>
<h2>Watson</h2>
<img src="images/watson.jpg">
<br>
<p>For a period of time Watson was a thriving district. People visited for the various Nightclubs, skyscrapers, corporate offices, a top-end medcenter, and even the biggest black market in all of Night City. Many Japanese corporations invested billions of eurodollars into the district competing with the giant Arasaka, their intent was to make it self-sufficient and prosperous. Everything changed after the Unification War, and Arasaka returned to the city. It bled the corporations dry and changed Watson forever. Without a stable financial sector, the glory days of Watson had ended: the North Industrial District, once a cutting edge technological park, could no longer provide jobs, leaving people out on the street. Arasaka took advantage of the economic vacuum by taking over the district for its gain. The Arasaka Corporation finally got the port-access on the waterfront that it had always wanted.</p>
<br>
<h2>Pacifica</h2>
<p>Originally made to be Night City's money making vacation resort. It was to be a true paradise catering to corporate employees and tourists alike with it's golden sandy beaches, luxurious hotels, and unmatched entertainment. This was before the economic collapse, causing much of the corporate funding to stop and the district was left unfinished and lawless.
Construction work was put on permanent hold, leaving most buildings unfinished, forever to remain the hulking concrete and steel shells they were at the time. The district has now since been overrun by poverty, violence, and gangs.</p> 
<img src="images/pacifica.jpg">
<p>All the buildings are now home to the homeless, rather than the tourists it was suspected to house.
The Voodoo Boys, a techno-mystical group of netrunners, made this place the base of their operations. Originating from the Haitian community that settled in Night City after their country was ravaged by climate disaster, they took it upon themselves to protect the local community, forsaken and left to fend for themselves by the NCPD.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Santo Domingo</h2>
<p>Santo Domingo is one of the oldest districts in Night City. Due to its location, the district avoided any major damage from the 4th Corporate War. It turned into a provisional camp for thousands of citizens seeking shelter. By 2077, the settlements were all gone and Santo Domingo had become a testing ground for industrial projects: corporations destroy old factories, only to build new ones in their place.
Meanwhile, residents scrape a desperate living in the crowded megabuildings — hoping for better things to come.</p> 
<img src="images/santo.jpg">
<p>It didn't take long for a couple of ex-military veterans to group together and take matters into their own hands. The district then became home to the 6th Street Gang.
Arroyo is the industrial heart of Santo Domingo. This region of contrast you can find an old nuclear power plant and junkyard right next to newly built high-tech corporate factories. Operational factories keep their own private security, as neglected buildings quickly become controlled by the gangs.
The workers from Arroyo then return home to Rancho Coronado — a self-sufficient housing district with dozens of identical homes. This neighborhood is reminiscent of the traditional american homes of the early 20th century.</p>
<br>
<h2>Heywood</h2>
<p>Heywood is seen as a district of complete contrast. The north borders the City Center, and is where you'll find lush parks and modern skyscrapers towering high above. However further south, the district changes drastically, with dangerous and unwelcoming slums dominating the urban landscape. The Valentinos and 6th Street gangs have control over this district, and are constantly fighting.
It's known by the locals as "the biggest bedroom in Night City." Due to a majority living in this area. The richer parts of Heywood are primarily occupied by corpos. For every rule there's always the exception — an odd soul from outside the corporate circle that occasionally manages to get an apartment. The rest are just happy they get to live in Heywood, with their only realistic alternatives being Pacifica or the industrial wasteland outside of the city.</p>
<img src="images/heywood.jpg">
<p>Wellsprings, the safest part of Heywood, is full of working stiffs and underpaid corporate employees. Much like any other american city in 2077.
After Night City got taken over by corporations, the government moved to Glen. It's now a state-owned sub-district with a town hall, mayor's office, court and a big NCPD station.
Vista Del Rey is the poorest part of the district. It's heavily under-invested, crime ridden, and slowly descending further into chaos, with many residents moving to other locations and more gang members moving into the empty void.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Badlands</h2>
<p>The Badlands are the vast plains outside of Night City. Populated by Nomads, it makes the city look more glamorous in comparison. However there's still life in here and golden opportunities. There are a lot of surprises out here.
Nomads aren't the only ones who call Badlands their home. A gang made up mostly of exiles from local tribes and families known as the Wraiths reside here, these are the guys responsible for the corporate transport disappearances.</p> 
<img src="images/badlands.png">
<p>Crossing into their territory without armed transport is suicide. Unchecked resource extraction and derelict oilfields dominate in the north. Wastelands full of chemicals and landfills reign supreme in the east. Acid rains are a result from the massive pollution, this guarantees nothing will ever grow here anytime soon, perhaps ever, while the winds carrying the unbearable stench that makes sure that Night City doesn't forget this place exists.
The south side is comprised of desert. Due to Biotechnicas's many protein farms, as well as the Jackson Plains power plant, this part of the badlands is less apocalyptic than the rest. Some even think it's safe around here, but let your guard down for a second and it'll eat you up alive.</p>
