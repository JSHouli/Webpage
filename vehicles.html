<h1>Stylish Rides</h1>
<br>
<p>Whether you're a normal civillian in a danky little economy class car or a corpo in a top of the line hyper car, there're plenty of rides for everyone</p>
<br>
<h2>Economy</h2>

<br>
<p>For those looking to get around in no-frills style, there’s the ‘Economy class.’
Featuring small city cars such as hatchbacks and basic runabouts, Economy class cars are common in poor and middle class areas. They won’t make you popular, but they should get you from A-to-B easily enough.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Executive</h2>

<br>
<p>Moving up in the world from the ‘Economy’ class, Executive cars are the best way to impress others in Night City without breaking the bank. If you’re a high-rolling assassin that still wants to blend in, the Executive class is the one for you.</p>
<br>
<h2>Heavy Duty</h2>

<br>
<p>From utility vehicles to mobile missile launchers, the Heavy-Duty class doesn’t let anything get in its way. Perfect for high levels of protection and use as impromptu battering rams, the vehicles in the heavy-duty category are perfect for when you really, really don’t want to slow down for anything.</p>
<br>
<h2>Sport</h2>

<br>
<p>Perfect for high-speed pursuits, sports cars blend performance with agility and style – ideal for quick getaways without breaking the bank. There are also a ton of upgrades and style changes available, to make your car unique in Night City.</p>
<br>
<h2>Hyper Cars</h2>

<br>
<p>Blending speed and armour into one stunning package, the hypercars class is the best-of-the-best Night City has to offer. Don’t expect such technology to come cheap, mind; These are some of the most costly cars in the world.</p>
<br>
<h2>Motorcycles</h2>

<br>
<p>There are a few motorcycle manufacturers in Night City but one of the more popular ones is ARCH because they created the infamous Arch Nasare CD. It's the perfect ride for darting through the bustling traffic of Night City.</p>
<br>
<p>That's pretty much all you need to know about the vehicles. That was just scratching the surface though, vehichles can come with a number of crazy upgrades that makes them that much more awesome!</p>
